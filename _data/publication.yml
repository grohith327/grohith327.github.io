- name: INCLUDE - A Large Scale Dataset for Indian Sign Language Recognition
  url: https://doi.org/10.1145/3394171.3413528
  description: We propose a large scale Isolated Indian Sign Language Recognition dataset and we evaluate several deep neural networks combining different methods for augmentation, feature extraction, encoding and decoding. We also identify a novel xgboost model which achieves competitive performance to deep neural networks.
