- name: Adversarial Training to improve Robustness of BERT
  url: https://github.com/grohith327/TextFooler
  code: https://github.com/grohith327/TextFooler
  description:
    - point: Obtained adversarial examples for the sentiment classification task which perturb the input words based on attention.
    - point: Performed Masked Language Model pre-training using the Pytorch framework on the adversarial samples to improve the robustness of the BERT model &amp; improved the adversarial accuracy from 13% to 66% on the IMDB dataset.

  code: 
  description:
    - point: Gathered the Latitude and Longitude values of objects present at the intersection of Jay St and Myrtle Ave and modelled them in ArcMap
    - point: Studied the movement of people crossing Jay St and modelled their interaction with the objects in the environment
    - point: Studied how obtrusion in footpath affects the mood of people by using Convolutional Neural Network to identify their emotions and used Moran's I statistic to measure its auto-correlation

- name: Artist Identification from a 5-sec snippet of a song
  url: https://bit.ly/33NAwMa
  code: https://bit.ly/33NAwMa
  description:
    - point: A real-time artist identification model that could identify the artist of a song
    - point: The recorded audio sample is denoised and a short-time fourier transform (STFT) is applied on the signal and converted to mel-scale
    - point: A Convolutional Neural Network is used as a feature extractor to create a fingerprint of the audio sample which is used to match it to samples in a database within the L2 Norm space
  used:
    - thing: TensorFlow 
    - thing: Signal Processing

- name: Automatic Speech Recognition

  code: https://bit.ly/2QjbQqO
  description:
    - point: An automatic speech recognition model that could automate certain tasks on a laptop such as taking picture, changing volume etc.
    - point: Created a dataset and preprocessed it to obtain the mel-spectrogram which is used as input by a Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Tensorflow to classify the audio commands real-time and perform the actions
